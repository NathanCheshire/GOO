# GOO
GOO stands for Group Order Optimizer and simply will find the maximum possible order for a symmetric group of degree n. The code has comments that explain everything you need to dchange should you try and use this program yourself. I believe there are still a few bugs in the code but I'll work them out later. I also couldn't come up with a generation algorithm before the midterm so I just decided to brute force it and it seemed to work well for symmetric groups 1-50.
